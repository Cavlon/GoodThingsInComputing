# Review 3006
Content is interesting and detailed with sufficient links to sources
Visuals are very consistent but is pretty bland and can be uninviting, especially the home page. The bootstrap logo also makes it seem less customised
No noticable spelling, grammar and punctuation mistakes, written content is formally written and effectively summarises information
Home page and surgery page have valid HTML but the other pages don't
Even distribution of commits from each group member and the author info for each is written by another member
There isn't an about me section for the authors decribing them
Images are very good and the surgery warning is a very nice implementation

Interesting Content: Excellent
Consistency and quality of visual representation: Very Good
Quality of written presentation: Outstanding
Validity of HTML: Very Good
Evidence of collaboration: Excellent
